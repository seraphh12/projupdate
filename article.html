            <h1>Analogy on the use of AI in Dev Work</h1>
            <p class="prob">You are organizing your wedding, the documentation team is asking 40k for the wedding package. They will use an Iphone 16 pro max to cover the event and CapCut for the same day edit video. The documentation team has 2 years of experience and has an above average portfolio. </p>

        <h1 class = "text">Documentation Team: Would you agree to that deal? ( ˶ˆ꒳ˆ˵ ) </h1>
        <h1 class = "text">Me: Nooo.... (๑-﹏-๑) </h1>
        <h1 class = "text">Documentation Team: Whyyy.... (╥﹏╥)</h1>
        <h1 class = "text">Me: Here's my reason --> </h1> </h1>

        <h2 class = "textn"> 1. The 40k wedding package for documentation is totally not worth it ૮(˶ㅠ︿ㅠ)ა : </h2>
        <p class = "why"> The PHP 40,000 package for coverage that uses a single iPhone 16 Pro Max and CapCut for the same-day edit is not worth the price. An iPhone can take great video in many situations, but paying for 40k should come with more than just a phone and a basic edit. The offer should include multiple cameras, professional audio, backup systems, and skilled operators.</p>

        <h2 class = "textn">2. No Reliability and Backups for risks (ᵕ—ᴗ—) : </h2>
        <p class = "why">Using an iPhone only as the main camera for documentation, the risks are:
            <br> <br>• Battery or storage failures. <br>• Limited lens/zoom options compared to dedicated video cameras. <br>• Potential overheating or app crashes during long shoots. <br>• Limited mounting/microphone options without extra gear. </p>
        <p class="why">If anything fails during the ceremony or reception of the wedding, the moments will not be documented.  A reputable team should guarantee backups in case of risks, at minimum of a second shooter for documentation and spare recording equipment. </p>

        <h2 class = "textn">3. The Audio quality will be not good (•́ ᴖ •̀) : </h2>
        <p class = "why">A good wedding video depends heavily on clear audio for vows, speeches, vows. Phone microphones and quick fixes in CapCut cannot match the clarity of professional wireless lavalier mics and separate recorders. If the team isn’t supplying professional audio capture such as lapel mics, a mixer, recorder, the overall product will feel amateur and the audio will not be audible. </p>

        <h2 class = "textn">4. Editing tools and videos on same-day (it's a big NO) (๑•̀ᗝ•́)૭ : </h2>
        <p class = "why">CapCut is a capable phone/tablet editing app and fine for quick social clips. But a same-day edit done in CapCut usually leads to:
            <br> <br>• Quicker, simpler cuts and transitions. <br>• Limited color grading and audio mixing. <br>• Lower export control (bitrate, color profiles). <br>• Fewer fine adjustments for pacing, music sync, and storytelling.</p>
        <p class="why">For a 40k for a memorable wedding film, it should have a properly graded, well-mixed final edit produced in professional desktop software. </p>


        <h1 class = "texty">Reflections on... (¬_¬")</h1>
        <h2 class = "textn">Integrity about their work: </h2>
        <p class = "why">Integrity means being truthful about what we will get. If the team markets itself as a “professional wedding videography” outfit but primarily shoots on phones and uses a phone app for editing without making that clear upfront, that’s misleading. We have the right to fully understand their tools, workflow, and what final deliverables will look like before paying.</p>

        <h2 class = "textn">Creativity in their documentations:  </h2>
        <p class = "why">An Iphone and CapCut can somehow make the video creative. They might make stylish and emotional clips, but in weddings it needs consistency and dependable technical skill and better editing software rather than CapCut to thoroughly enhance and develop the creativity of their work (because of limitations of CapCut). Creativity in documentations should be paired with reliable equipment, good editing software and sound capture.</p>

        <h2 class = "textn">Skill level based on their portfolio:  </h2>
        <p class = "why">Two years and an above-average portfolio can somehow have solid basic skill, having composition, sense of rhythm, and editing taste. But skill gaps likely remain, such as low-light performance, multi-camera switching, audio mixing, and complex color grading are areas where more experience usually shows.There are many other people that have deeper, more technical abilities that only time, practice, and professional equipment can develop. Wedding events truly demand a high level of skill because you only get one chance to capture everything. With only two years of experience, there is a higher chance that the final output might not look as polished as someone who has more than 2 years of experience, a better portfolio, and more reliable equipment and editing software to use in the documentation.</p>

        <h1 class="texty">Conclusion: ITS A BIG NO, NOO, NOO!!  (≖_≖) </h1>
