                    <p class="card-text2"> <br> AI models learn patterns from vast amounts of training data that may include stereotypes, incomplete information, or skewed representations. This bias can appear in AI-generated outputs in multiple ways, such as misrepresenting certain groups in hiring systems or reinforcing unfair assumptions in healthcare decision-making. 
                        <br> <br> Bias in training data directly affects AI-generated outputs. Organizations must test for bias and evaluate models before deployment to ensure fairness. Researchers should disclose the limitations of generative AI systems, including their potential for bias, and adopt mitigation strategies accordingly. Generative AI models also need constant oversight from humans. Organizations should not treat AI as static tools, and they should conduct regular audits of generated data to ensure accuracy, identify potential biases, and assess security risks.</p>
